            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m a Software Engineer at Rocket Software, originally from Ranchi, Jharkhand, India. My passion for engineering began in childhood, sparked by my first experience with programming in Logo. The joy of coding captivated me early on and ultimately guided me toward a career in software engineering. I specialize in backend development, particularly using Java and Spring, while also enjoying the challenge of crafting artistic and intuitive web frontends. </p>
            <p>In my day-to-day job, I enjoy delving into complex problems and iterating for elegant solutions using various technologies. My expertise includes performance optimization, API integrations, and large-scale database migrations. I'm passionate about continuous learning and staying up-to-date with emerging technologies.</p>
            <p> I enjoy mentoring & collaborating with developers and leading proof-of-concept projects. I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments and am committed to creating robust, secure, and efficient software solutions.</p>
            <p>Beyond coding, I enjoy travelling and discussing philosophy. I enjoy watching cricket and reading interesting articles. I love to follow interesting people from various backgrounds and enjoy knowing about things which they do and talk about. I am free thinker and I believe everyone should lead their life in the way they like.</p>
