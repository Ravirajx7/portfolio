        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a Software Engineer with 4+ years under my belt, specializing in full-stack development and microservices architecture. I’ve spent my career designing and building scalable, user-friendly applications—basically, I turn complex problems into elegant solutions with the help of Java, Spring, React, and a good dose of cloud magic.

            I’m big on performance optimization, API integrations, and navigating the maze of large-scale database migrations. My love for tech means I’m always learning, whether it’s about the latest emerging technologies or just how to get that one stubborn bug to finally cooperate.

            Beyond the code, I enjoy mentoring fellow developers and leading proof-of-concept projects that actually prove something. I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments—because what’s better than solving tough problems with a great team? Oh, and I’m all about creating software that’s not just robust and secure, but also efficient enough to keep our future robot overlords happy.
